# General programming rules

- Don't put comments on code (except for the method documentation)
- Document methode only whe thier name is not enought explicit. E.g: dont write doc comment fo a methode `GetUserName`
- When ther is an abstraction, document methodes ONLY in the abstraction, no in the implementation(s)
- Write all in english
