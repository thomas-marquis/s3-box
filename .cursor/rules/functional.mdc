# S3-Box Functional Rules

## Overview
S3-Box is a desktop application for navigating and managing files and folders on S3-compatible storage. It is written in Go, follows Domain Driven Design (DDD), and uses the Fyne framework for its graphical user interface.

## Main Features

### 1. S3 Connection Management
- Users can create, edit, delete, and select S3 connections.
- The connections are presisted
- Each connection includes server, access key, secret key, bucket, region, and TLS usage.
- Only one connection can be active at a time; switching connections resets the file explorer tree.

### 2. File Explorer
- Users can browse S3 buckets and directories in a tree view.
- Directories and files are loaded on demand.
- Selecting a directory shows its details and allows file upload.
- Selecting a file shows its details and allows preview (if its size is bellow a given limit), download, and deletion.

### 3. File Operations
- **Upload:** Users can upload files from their local system to the selected S3 directory.
- **Download:** Users can download files from S3 to their local system.
- **Preview:** Users can preview files up to a configurable size limit.
- **Delete:** Users can delete files from S3 directories.

### 4. Directory Operations
- Directories are aggregates; they contain subdirectories and files.
- Users can navigate into subdirectories and see their contents.
- Directory consistency is maintained when files are added or removed.
- A directory reference its sub-directories bt their IDs
- A directory ID is its paths (ending with a "/")

### 5. Settings
- Users can configure:
  - Timeout for S3 operations
  - Color theme (light, dark, system)
  - Maximum file size for preview
- Settings are validated and persisted.

### 6. Error Handling & Feedback
- Errors and confirmations are shown via dialogs.
- Operations like upload, download, and delete provide user feedback.

### 7. UI/UX
- The application uses Fyne for a modern, responsive desktop UI.
- Navigation between explorer, settings, and connection management is seamless.

## Domain Model
- **S3Directory:** Aggregate representing a directory in S3, containing subdirectories and files.
- **S3File:** Entity representing a file in S3, with metadata (name, size, last modified, etc).
- **Connection:** Represents an S3 connection configuration.
- **Settings:** User preferences for the application.

## Technical Notes
- All business logic is in `/internal`.
- Infrastructure (S3 API, persistence) is in `/internal/infrastructure`.
- UI code is in `/internal/ui` and is framework-specific.
- Domain code is framework-agnostic and lives in `/internal/explorer`, `/internal/connection`, etc.
